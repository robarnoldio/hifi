# Old guys don't hear so good

## Overview

Before wasting a bunch of electrons writing about how good my room and/or system sounds, I thought it may be useful to examone my own sense of hearing. 

Today's post is brought to you by the word [presbycusis](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss), which is age-related hearing loss. 

So just maybe I'm one of the many afflicted people, and you should discount anything I have to say about music or whatever because I am going deaf anyway. Or at least, that's a thing I considered as I was lanning to document all this mess. But this is a good news post--I recently got a new set of Apple AirPods Pro, which allows an easy, at-home way to get a hearing test. While this is not a substitute for seeing an audiologist, it's a nice sanity check that I can share with you.

Besides being an old dude in general, I also played in bands on stage for 11 years, and I am amazed that I seem to have avoided lasting damage from that experience. I was *not* diligent about hearing protection, and as someone with friends who suffer from a variety of hearing issues, I'd like to encourage anyone to protect their hearing when incurring noise exposure. I do wear my headphones in noise cancel mode when mowing my yard now.

## If it's too loud, you're too old

Well, that may not be the most productive slogan. Mastering engineers try to use a reference level of 83 dB as a consistent benchmark of loudness. I don't always whip out my meter and check, but my customary listening volumes tend to stay pretty close to that level. It's loud enough that you won't be able to carry on a conversation in the room most of the time.
