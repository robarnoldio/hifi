# Talking about measurement

## Terms and conditions

One of the things that makes this a technical blog instead of some random crank expressing opinions is that I will try my best to precisely use technical terms and units to describe the things I'm talking about. So, a random crank *with an engineering degree* expressing opinions *with precision*. With the caveat that I don't work in the engineering field.

On this page, I'll try to condense down the most important parts that I learned from an entire course I took called "Electrical measurements" and combine that with a few things from audio engineering and from music theory that I thing will help us have that more precise conversation. Maybe this page can be a helpful guidepost in later posts.

## Things to know about measurements

Measurements have error. Error is the difference between the true quantitiy and the measured quantity. Error can be observational or systematic.

> If a 1kg calibrated reference mass gives you a scale reading of 999g, that is a 1g error. If the error is consistent across repeated measurements, that is systematic error. If my scale isn't clean because I was making bread and got four on it, that could be a source of observational error. My coffee scale (which I love and use for all kinds of things) is rated to be accurate wit a one gram error in the range from 



People who take measurements seriously tend to state the uncertainty in their measurements, in order to convey both the accuracy and precision.

Even without a statement of uncertainty, the number of significant digits in a measurement can imply a precision.

## Electrical quantities to know

- First note
- Second note

## Audio quantities to know

- Frequency, measured in Hz (Hertz), is equivalent to cycles per second.
- Sound pressure level, mesured in B (bels) or more commonly dB (decibels) is 

## Musical quantities to know

- An octave is the pitch distance between two muscial notes that share the same name (pitch class). In musical terms, 440Hz is defined as A4 by international standard [ISO 16:1975](https://www.iso.org/standard/3601.html). A5 is one octave above A4, and is 880Hz. A6 is twice the frequency of A5. A3 (220Hz) is half the frequency of A4.
- Harmonics are the music theory term for integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. Physical objects that vibrate tend to also vibrate at a series of multiples of their fundamental frequency
