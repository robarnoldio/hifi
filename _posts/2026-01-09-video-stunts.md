## The tricksy bit

I did a first set of videos where I had my meter in one hand and my phone in the other, and I walked around and it was nauseatingly bad. The worst. So I decided to build a jig to hold my meter and camera at a fixed distance so I can maybe not induce vomiting.

## scrap lumber and pocket hole screws

90% of this is two boards I screwed together at a right angle. Then the other super advanced technology is a bunch of holes I drilled so I can use a 1/4-20 threaded knob to mount my meter and my phone grabber/holder. A bunch of camera mount stuff is 1/4-20 so I have some experience hacking mounts to meet my needs. Wallace and Gromit would be proud of some of my contraptions.

## shut up and show it to me

I was getting distracting reflections in the meter lens so I used the white paper to get rid of that. If I use this more than 1-2 more times I may make a nicer version from *better* scrap lumber and paint it white instead.

Pretty cool, eh?
