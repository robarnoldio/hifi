    <h1 class="post-title">About my stereo</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>This is my blog about  messing with my stereo. I mainly listen to records, and I’ve got a relatively substantial <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/Robarnold/collection">collection</a>. Right now, my gear looks like this:</p>

<h1 id="ortofon-2m-bronze">Ortofon 2M Bronze</h1>

<p><a href="https://ortofon.com/products/2m-bronze">2M Bronze specs</a></p>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_8392.jpeg" alt="2M Bronze cartridge" /></p>

<p>I bought this new at my local record shop in 2023. I replaced a 2M red that went onto my kid’s setup. Bronze gets you a nude fine line stylus geometry, which I wanted to get better detail that I was hearing. I have to say the red stacks up pretty damn well against this thing at a quarter of the price though.</p>

<h1 id="yamaha-yp-800-turntable-1976">Yamaha YP-800 turntable (1976)</h1>

<p><a href="https://vintage-turntable.com/yamaha-yp-800.html">YP-800 specs</a></p>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_8393.jpeg" alt="YP-800 turntable" /></p>

<p>This direct drive turntable comes with a Grace G-840F tonearm, HS-800 aluminum headshell, 2kg die cast aluminum platter, and 12 pole brushless motor. I got this item used for in the neighborhood of $200, though it’s difficult to pin down exactly what I paid since I flipped up three other turntables to buy it. Each of those three was a yard sale find for $15 or under.</p>

<p>I gained two main benefits when I upgraded to this deck–I can set the tonearm height, and the speed stability is unbelievably improved. My last daily driver had a lot of wow and was quite distracting when listening to piano solos. This deck comprehensively fixed that.</p>

<p>I have modified the feet, replacing them with a cheap set of spring loaded aluiminum feet from Temu (from that household brand, HHDZI). I drilled holes in these so I could convert them to leveling feet like what I removed. I have the original slipmat, but am using a homemade leather mat for right now (I love the static reduction).</p>

<h1 id="yamaha-cr-420-receiver-1977">Yamaha CR-420 Receiver (1977)</h1>

<p><a href="https://classicreceivers.com/yamaha-cr-420">CR-420 specs</a></p>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_8394.jpeg" alt="CR-420 Receiver" /></p>

<p>This is rated at 22W/channel into 8 ohms, but punches way above its weight. The silverface look is super classic, and this is the bottom of the line that included models CR-620, 820, 1020, 2020, and even the elusive 3020. These are regularly bringing a couple hundred bucks on the used market, but I nabbed mine from a local seller for $40. My good friend Brett teched it up into fine shape and it sounds great.</p>

<h1 id="klipsch-rf-5-floorstanding-speakers-early-2000s">Klipsch RF-5 floorstanding speakers (early 2000s)</h1>

<p><a href="https://d2um2qdswy1tb0.cloudfront.net/spec-sheets/RF-5-Floorstanding-Speaker.pdf?v=1725388891">RF-5 specs</a></p>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_5188.jpeg" alt="RF-5 nameplate" /></p>

<p>One key reason I don’t need a monster amp, besides my room size, is that these Klipsch speakers are ridiculously efficent at 99dB/W. I put some 3” carriage bolts into the outrigger feet to get these guys up off the carpet. I got these for free from my old boss (thanks, Gary, I love them). My speaker wires are low-cost zip cord style terminated in pin jacks. The receiver has spring loaded clips and the speakers have 4-way binding posts, and this keeps things nice and tidy.</p>

<p>I would love to find a pair of RF-7 (flagships) to replace these, but for now I’m rocking these.</p>
