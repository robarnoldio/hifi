    <h2 id="storage-goals">Storage goals</h2>

<p>When you have too many records, getting to the spot where the one you want to play is stored is a challenge. Since the 1980’s I’ve used corrugated storage cartons for my collection. They are terrible for browsing though, even though I have to say they kept my collection in great condition over a couple decades of not accessing the records.</p>

<p>So my start point on the storage journey was records in clear outer sleeves, stored in corrugated cartons, of which I accumulated about 12.</p>

<p>I decided it needed to be a lot more browse friendly. So I took the opportunity to build a shelf unit that I thought would accomplish my goal of a better browse experience. This post is about the process that culminated in that furniture being installed.</p>

<h2 id="sketching-it-out">Sketching it out</h2>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_0710.jpeg" alt="early drawing of the design of my record furniture" /></p>

<p>My initial thoughts revolved around a 4-foot long cabinet that would be roughtly 2 feet tall, in order to hold two shelves of LPs (which are about 12-1/4 inches in outer jackets). Keeping it simple, I planned a rectngular carcass with an open back (I thought about partial stops tht keep the records from sliding too far back in the opening–it’s a good idea that I chose to skip). Then my gear can sit on top of the shelf. Iron hairpin legs keep the carcass off the floor.</p>

<p>The idea of the vertical dividers initially was to give me a space to slide a 12 inch storage cube (kind of a common size, Ikea and others sell these in several styles) to hold my “Accessories” that I didn’t want to put on display but need to be close at hand.</p>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_0712.jpeg" alt="later dimensioned drawing of the design of my record furniture" /></p>

<p>I figured the height of the openings at 13 inches, but at build time I added an inch, which was a super good decision. The boards I used for this were glueups made from Aspen wood, finished on four sides and 48” x 11-1/2” x 3/4”. Keeping the shelves as long as possible meant leaving the horizontal boards uncut–all the cuts were for the vertical pieces.</p>

<h2 id="initial-test-assembly">Initial test assembly</h2>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_7396.jpeg" alt="cut pieces being &quot;dry fit&quot;" /></p>

<p>Before getting out the pocket hole jig and drilling, I checked my pieces for fit by laying it out on the shop floor.</p>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_7397.jpeg" alt="assembled carcass" /></p>

<p>I don’t have pics of the pocket holes or jig but if you’ve used one, you know it make simple joinery like this go pretty quick. I got the box put together in under an hour, almost as if it were a kit rather than custom designed.</p>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_7452.jpeg" alt="shot of the top being finished&quot;" /></p>

<p>For me the most controversial choice was using water based polyurethane finish–Amy didn’t want it to show any yellowing, which normal poly will give you. To increase the Wife Acceptance Factor (WAF) we used the water-based stuff. It’s quite clear and this is after maybe six coats where I sanded between applications.</p>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_7464.jpeg" alt="finished with legs attached&quot;" /></p>

<p>And once I felt like more coats of poly was not going to inproe it, I added the legs. Astute readers will notice I places the accessory bin spot in the upper shelf unlike in my sketch. It seemed like a better design choice, and it also let me use the nicer shelf as the top. Haha, I immediately filled it with records anyway instead of using it as designed.</p>

<h2 id="dimensions-and-stuff">Dimensions and stuff</h2>

<p>I estimate this holds about 500 records, plus or minus 10%. I did not really put enough thought into the weight and how the span would sag. I’d say there’s a 1/4” sag in the horizontal shelves (measured between the center and ends) and fortunately my leveling feet on my turntable allow me to compensate. If I rebuild or replace this, i’ll stiffen it by adding the stop boards in the back of the openings. I would also like it if I had better lighting when selecting a record, maybe that goes into version 2.0.</p>

<p>The 11-1/2” depth is not really enough for my vintage components to securely sut on, so I am just resting an unfinished board that is 16” deep on the top of the unit. I may choose to wall-mount that board as a shelf, thereby further decoupling the equipment from being disturbed when I pull or replace a record from the rack.</p>

<p>If I find a nice chunk of butcher block countertop that is long enough, I’ll add that to the top of this but fhe cheap board hack is working for now.</p>
